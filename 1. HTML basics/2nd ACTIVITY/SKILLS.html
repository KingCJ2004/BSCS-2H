            <h3><dt>COMMUNICATION</dt></h3>
            <dd>-Communication is by whether information is exchanged between humans, members of other species, or non-living entities such as computers. 
                For human communication, a central contrast is between verbal and non-verbal communication.
                Verbal communication involves the exchange of messages in linguistic form, including spoken and written messages as well as sign language. Non-verbal communication happens without the use of a linguistic system, for example, using body language, touch, and facial expressions. Another distinction is between interpersonal communication, which happens between distinct persons, and intrapersonal communication, which is communication with oneself. Communicative competence is the ability to communicate well and applies to the skills of formulating messages and understanding them.</dd>
            <h3><dt>PROBLEM SLOVING</dt></h3>
            <dd>-Problem-solving skills are the ability to identify problems, brainstorm and analyze answers, and implement the best solutions. An employee with good problem-solving skills is both a self-starter and a collaborative teammate; they are proactive in understanding the root of a problem and work with others to consider a wide range of solutions before deciding how to move forward. </dd>
            <h3><dt>LEADERSHIP</dt></h3>
            <dd>-Leadership is the ability to guide, inspire, and influence individuals or groups towards achieving common goals or objectives. It involves setting a vision, making strategic decisions, and fostering a positive environment that encourages growth, collaboration, and high performance.</dd>
